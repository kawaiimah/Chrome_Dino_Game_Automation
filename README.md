# Chrome_Dino_Game_Automation
My exploration into automation using the pyautogui library.

## Coding Concepts
- Use of pyautogui library
- Detecting pixel colors at various locations on screen
- Detecting if a reference png is on screen
- Automating mouse clicks on screen
- Detecting obstacles approaching the dino in the game and automating key presses to jump or crouch

## Notes
There are many more (better!) examples online that finetune the approach adopted in my code to better detect obstacles and adapt to the increasing speed as the game progresses, as well as using other approaches such as via machine learning!
